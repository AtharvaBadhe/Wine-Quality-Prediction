# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on various features like acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol levels. Using a dataset of red and white wines, we apply algorithms to classify wine quality and provide insights for wine producers and enthusiasts.
